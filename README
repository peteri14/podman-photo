This is an educational project to demonstrate how to create several cooperating containers manually.
This is not normal! In reality OpenShift or similar system should be used.

There is a very simple PHP photo gallery web application in the 'code' directory, which requires
three daemons:
- httpd
    This is an Apache server.
- php-fpm
    This is required for new Apache to execute PHP code via the fastCGI proxy system.
- mysql
    This is the database.
These processes/daemons are "packaged" into three different containers.

Directory structure:
- code: PHP code to implement a photo gallery
- php: files for Dockerfile-php
- www: files for Dockerfile-www
- images: pictures from the internet for demonstration

Theoretically everything is automatic to create and run the system:
- modify the parameters in file 'env'
  IP addresses are the internal IP addresses in 10.88.0.0/16 (see man podman)
- execute 'build.sh'
- execute 'start.sh'

Have fun.
